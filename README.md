## üß™ Abstract

This study investigates the metabolic pathways of inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) in the yeast cell line ŒîSPX and the human tumor cell line HCT116. Utilizing pulse-labelling experiments with ¬π‚Å∏O water and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore the synthesis and turnover of the highly phosphorylated IPP, 1,5-InsP‚Çà. Our findings challenge the notion that 1,5-InsP‚Çà can be synthesized through distinct routes, revealing a linear reaction sequence in both systems.

Using model reduction via the profile likelihood method, we achieved statistically concise identifiability analysis that led to significant biological insights. In yeast, 1,5-InsP‚Çà production primarily occurs through phosphorylation of 5-InsP‚Å∑, while in HCT116 cells, it is driven mainly by 1-InsP‚Å∑, with variations observed under different phosphate conditions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/The_break_in_the_cycle.git
   ```

2. Open RStudio and load one of the main scripts for a specific condition (e.g. `model_full.R` inside a condition folder).

3. Each script sets its working directory automatically and includes comments guiding execution.

4. Output includes:

   * Parameter estimates
   * Identifiability profiles
   * Plots of model fits and reductions
